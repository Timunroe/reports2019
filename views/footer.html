<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">TRAFFIC PRIMER</h3>
<p>Traffic is described by 5 categories: 4 external (social, search, direct, other) and internal.</p>
<p><strong> Internal</strong>: Usually from home page to article, though also from article to article via related links, most read etc.</p>
<p><strong>Search</strong>: Google overwhelmingly, though also Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo.</p>
<p><strong>Social</strong>: Networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Reddit etc. Users supply most of the links.</p>
<p><strong>Direct</strong>: We don’t know how users got there because the source doesn’t provide the information.<br />
If talking about <em>site</em> traffic, it mostly means people who type ‘thespec.com’ in the browser or have bookmarked the site. <br />
If talking about <em>article</em> traffic, the user likely didn't type in the full URL, but came from a newsletter email, texting app or some other app such as Reddit's or Facebook Messenger.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Other</strong>: Curation services such as Google News, Apple News, Flipboard, SmartNews etc.</p>
